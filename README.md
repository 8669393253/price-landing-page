Price landing page is a web page specifically designed to showcase and highlight pricing information for a product, service, or subscription. The goal of a price landing page is to provide potential customers with clear details about the cost and value of what is being offered, ultimately encouraging them to make a purchase or sign up for a service.

Document Structure: The HTML document follows the standard structure with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration, <html> tag, and <head> section containing meta tags, title, linked stylesheets, and scripts.
Header Section: The <header> section features a navigation bar with a logo, navigation links, a search bar, and login/register buttons. It has a responsive design that adapts to smaller screens.
Content Sections: Multiple <div> elements structure the main content. Sections include a hero section, features, pricing plans, a carousel, and a contact form. Each section is styled with a clean and organized layout.
Sidebar: The sidebar is implemented with a toggle button (#sidebarToggle) and a <div> (#sidebar). It provides navigation links to different sections of the page.
Pricing Plans: The pricing plans section includes different subscription options displayed in a responsive pricing table. Each plan has details such as the plan name, description, price, and a "Get Started" button.
Carousel: A carousel showcases additional plans with a slide effect. Users can navigate through different plans using navigation buttons (#prevBtn and #nextBtn).
Checkout Section: A checkout table allows users to select subscription plans and displays the total price dynamically based on the selected options. Users can check and uncheck plans to update the total.
Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive, with media queries adjusting the design for smaller screens. The sidebar is toggleable on screens with a width less than 600 pixels.
Footer: The <footer> section includes a copyright notice, providing information about the page's ownership and rights.
CSS Styling: The CSS file (pricing-landing.css) contains styles for the entire page, including the header, navigation, content sections, sidebar, buttons, forms, and responsive design. The styling emphasizes a clean and professional appearance.
JavaScript Functionality: JavaScript functions handle the toggling of the sidebar (toggleSidebar()) and the navigation of the carousel (nextSlide() and prevSlide()).
Additional Comments: The code includes comments to enhance readability and provide brief explanations for specific sections or functions.
